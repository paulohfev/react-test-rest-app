# react-test-rest-app
Simple app for studying and prototyping REST operations.

Made with React, and uses axios and the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API

### Important Observation:
It should be noted that using the JSONPlaceholder API will not allow you to mutate, in any form, any data from its server. This means that POST, PATCH/PUT and DELETE requests are simulated, with faked responses sent back.
